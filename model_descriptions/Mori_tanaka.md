## Spherical isotropic inclusions ramdomly dispersed

Inclusions are still seeing first the matrix in their surrounding but some of the inclusion interactions are taken into account.

$$\bar{K}=K_1+\frac{f(K_f-K_m)(3K_m+4G_m)}{3K_f+4G_m+3(1-f)(K_f-K_m)}$$
$$\bar{G}=G_m+\frac{5fG_m(G_f-G_m)(3K_m+4G_m)}{5G_m(3K_m+4G_m)+6(1-f)(G_f-G_m)(K_m+2G_m)}$$
