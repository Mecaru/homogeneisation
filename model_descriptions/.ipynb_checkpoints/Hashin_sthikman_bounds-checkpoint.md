The HS bounds are the tightest bounds without taking into consideration the geometry of the microstructure. 

Lower bound (Assuming the matrix is the softest phase):
$$K^-_{HS}=K_m+\frac{f}{\frac{1}{K_f-K_m}+\frac{3(1-f)}{3K_m+4G_m}}$$

$$G^-_{HS}=G_m+\frac{f}{\frac{1}{G_f-G_m}+\frac{6(1-f)(K_m+2G_m)}{5G_m(3K_m+4G_m})}$$

Upper bound:
$$K^+_{HS}=K_f+\frac{1-f}{\frac{1}{K_m-K_f}+\frac{3f}{3K_f+4G_f}}$$

$$G^+_{HS}=G_f+\frac{f}{\frac{1}{G_m-G_f}+\frac{6f(K_f+2G_f)}{5G_f(3K_f+4G_f})}$$
